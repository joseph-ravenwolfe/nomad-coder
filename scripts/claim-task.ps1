<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Claims a task from 2-queued/ by staging a baseline snapshot at 4-completed/
    and moving the working copy to 3-in-progress/.

.DESCRIPTION
    1. git mv  task from 2-queued/ → 4-completed/YYYY-MM-DD/  (stages baseline)
    2. Move-Item  from 4-completed/YYYY-MM-DD/ → 3-in-progress/  (working copy)

    When the task runner finishes and moves the file back to 4-completed/,
    `git diff` shows only the additions (Findings, Completion sections).

.PARAMETER TaskFile
    Filename of the task to claim (e.g., "10-040-review-loop-prompt.md").

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\claim-task.ps1 10-040-review-loop-prompt.md
