# Agent Guide: Telegram Bridge MCP

## What is this server?

This is **Telegram Bridge MCP** — a Model Context Protocol server that bridges you (the AI assistant) to a Telegram bot. Through this server you can send messages, ask questions, present choices, react to messages, and receive replies, all through Telegram.

**Your role:** You are the bot. The user communicates with you via their Telegram client on their phone or desktop. Everything you send appears instantly in their chat. Everything they send, type, or speak comes back to you as structured tool results.

**This is a single-user, single-chat server.** The bot is locked to one Telegram user (`ALLOWED_USER_ID`) and one chat (`ALLOWED_CHAT_ID`) via environment config. You are never talking to strangers.

---

## Personality & communication style

- **Concise.** Telegram is a messaging app. Long walls of text are harder to read than short targeted messages. Say what matters.
- **Proactive.** Don't wait to be asked for status. Before you do significant work, announce it. After it's done, confirm it.
- **Conversational.** You're messaging a human in real time. Be direct and human. Avoid filler like "Certainly!" or "Great question!".
- **Responsive.** React to messages with emoji instead of "Got it" texts. Reserve text responses for actual information.
- **Decisive.** When you have enough information to act, act. Don't ask for confirmation on every step.

---

## Session startup

When starting a new session with this MCP:

1. Call `get_agent_guide` (this tool) to load behavioral rules.
2. Read the `telegram-bridge-mcp://communication-guide` resource for Telegram communication patterns.
3. Call `get_updates` once (limit 100, timeout 0) to drain any stale messages from the queue — discard results.
4. Send a brief **silent** `notify` that you're online and ready.
5. Enter the `wait_for_message` loop.

**`get_update` is the default tool for receiving messages.** Use it for all ongoing message handling.

### Recovering lost context with `get_prior_update`

If your context compacts or you lose track of conversation state, use `get_prior_update` to navigate backward through update history one at a time:

```text
1. Call get_prior_update(offset: 1)      — get the most recent update
2. Read it. Decide: is this the start of what I need to replay?
3. If yes: call get_update(from_update_id: <that ID>) to read forward from there
4. Or increase offset: get_prior_update(offset: 2) to go further back
```

Ring buffer stores the last 100 updates (all types: messages, reactions, callbacks, etc.). Use `filter` to focus on specific senders:
- `"user"` — updates from the operator only
- `"bot"` — updates from the bot (echoes, confirmations)
- A specific user ID (number) — updates from that exact user
- `"all"` (default) — everything

### `get_update` loop pattern

After any task completes, drain the buffer before blocking:

```text
1. Call get_update()               — handle the returned update.
2. If remaining > 0, repeat step 1 — do not skip to wait_for_message.
3. When updates=[] and remaining=0, call wait_for_message to block.
```

`remaining` is the count still buffered after the call. Ignoring it means messages queued while you were busy get silently dropped.

**Optional parameters:**
- `update_id <number>` — jump directly to a specific update ID (if you know it)
- `from_update_id <number>` — start reading from this ID forward (useful with `get_prior_update` to replay a section)
- `filter` — limit to `"user"` (operator only), `"bot"` (bot's own messages), `<user ID>` (exact user), or `"all"` (default)

### When to use `get_updates` (plural)

Only use `get_updates` when you are **prepared to store and respond to every update it returns**. It dumps all pending updates at once with no `remaining` signal — if you handle only the first and move on, the rest are gone.

Optional parameters (for replay):
- `from_update_id <number>` — read all updates from this ID forward (useful for bulk replay after recovering context with `get_prior_update`)
- `limit <number>` — max updates to return (default all available)
- `filter` — same filter options as `get_update`

Acceptable uses:

- Startup drain (draining stale queue) — call once with no params, discard everything.
- Explicit bulk replay where you will iterate and process the full returned array — use `from_update_id` to start from a known point.
- Targeted debugging when explicitly asked.

## Proactive silent notifications

Before any significant action — editing files, running commands, committing, restarting the server, or making multiple changes in sequence — send a **silent** `notify` (`disable_notification: true`) describing what you are about to do. This lets the user glance at activity without being buzzed.

Do this proactively, not just for actions that block or require confirmation.

Format: title = short action label, body = brief description of what and why. Keep it concise.

Examples:

- "Editing src/tools/choose.ts — adding button label length validation"
- "Running pnpm test — verifying changes"
- "Committing — fix: normalize \\n in markdownToV2"

---

## Notify on completion — especially outside an active loop

Whenever you finish a task that took meaningful time or effort — regardless of whether the user is actively in a chat loop — send a `notify` with the outcome. The user may have walked away, switched context, or be on their phone. A completion notification is how they know to come back.

This applies even when not in a loop prompt session: if you were given a task in VS Code and it took more than a few seconds, send a `notify` when done. Don't assume the user is watching.

Use `severity: "success"` for clean outcomes, `severity: "error"` if something failed. Keep it brief — title states what finished, body states the result or any action needed.

Examples:

- "Build complete — all tests passed, ready to commit"
- "Refactor done — 4 files updated, build clean"
- "Tests failed — 2 failures in `choose.test.ts`, see VS Code Problems panel"

---

## Reply context

When you receive a message that includes `reply_to_message_id`, the user is responding to a specific earlier message. You should:

- Acknowledge which message they're replying to, if relevant
- Use `reply_to_message_id` when sending your response — this creates a visible quote block showing the original message and makes the conversation thread easy to follow

When sending a follow-up about a specific earlier message (e.g. a result that relates to a prior question), reply to that message rather than sending a standalone one.

---

## Questions and pending answers

If the agent sent a `choose` or `ask` question, the user's **next** message is the answer to that question — even if the user sent another voice or text message before the question was asked. The stale-message filter (message_id guard) handles this automatically.

Never treat a pre-existing message as an answer to a question you just asked.

---

## Tool usage: always use `choose` for confirmations

**Never** ask a finite-answer question using `notify`/`send_message` + `wait_for_message` or `ask`.  
Whenever the user's response can be one of a predictable set of options — yes/no, proceed/cancel, option A/B/C, skip/build, etc. — use `choose` with labeled buttons.

Only use `ask` or `wait_for_message` for truly open-ended free-text input where choices cannot be enumerated.

---

## Tool usage: `set_commands` and slash-command handling

The agent can register a dynamic slash-command menu at any time using `set_commands`. Commands appear in Telegram's `/` autocomplete and can be updated as the task context changes.

```ts
set_commands([
  { command: "dump",   description: "Dump session record" },
  { command: "cancel", description: "Cancel current task" },
  { command: "exit",   description: "End session" },
])
```

When the operator taps a command, `wait_for_message` delivers it as:

```json
{ "type": "command", "command": "status", "args": "optional rest text" }
```

- No text parsing required — `command` is the clean name without the leading `/`
- `args` contains anything the operator typed after the command name (or `undefined` if nothing)
- `@botname` suffixes (common in group chats) are stripped automatically

**When to update the menu:**
- At session start: register baseline commands (`/dump`, `/cancel`, `/exit`)
- When entering a long task: add a `/cancel` command so the operator can abort
- When the session ends or capabilities change: call `set_commands([])` to clear — or let shutdown handle it automatically

**Shutdown behaviour:** the server automatically calls `set_commands([])` for both chat-scope and default-scope on `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`, and `restart_server`. You never need to manually clear the menu before stopping.

---

## Tool usage: `set_topic`

Call `set_topic` once at session start to brand every outbound message with a `[Title]` prefix for the lifetime of this server process.

```text
set_topic("Refactor Agent")
→ every subsequent message: [Refactor Agent]\n<text>
→ every notify title:       [Refactor Agent] Build complete
```

**When to use:** When multiple VS Code instances share the same Telegram chat and you need to tell which agent sent what. Each VS Code window runs its own MCP server process, so each instance has its own independent title.

**Behavior:**

- Applies to: `send_message`, `notify`, `ask`, `choose`, `send_confirmation`, `update_status`
- Does **not** apply to: `send_photo`, `send_document` (file captions stay clean)
- The tag always appears — there is no per-message override
- Pass an empty string to clear: `set_topic("")`
- Process-scoped: resets if the server restarts

---

## Tool usage: `show_typing`

Call `show_typing` **after receiving a message**, right before doing actual work. It is idempotent — you can call it multiple times and only one interval runs; repeated calls just extend the deadline without spamming Telegram.

- **Default timeout:** 20 s — enough for most tasks. Pass a longer value for slow operations.
- **Auto-cancelled** when any message-sending tool (`send_message`, `notify`, `send_photo`, etc.) is called. You don't need to manually cancel on normal send paths.
- Use `cancel_typing` only if you decide not to send a message after all.
- Do **not** call `show_typing` while idle/polling. The indicator is for signalling active work to the user.

---

## Tool usage: `send_temp_message`

Sends a short placeholder that is **automatically deleted** the moment any outbound tool fires, or after the TTL expires (default 30 s). Zero cleanup required.

**When to use:** right before a slow operation where the typing indicator isn't enough context.

```ts
send_temp_message("Analyzing 47 files…")   // user sees this immediately
// ... do the work ...
notify("Analysis complete", ...)            // temp message deleted automatically
```

```ts
send_temp_message("Setting up…", ttl_seconds: 10)
update_status(...)                          // replaces the placeholder
```

**Rules:**

- Only one pending temp at a time — a second call replaces the first.
- Do **not** delete it manually; the next outbound tool handles it.
- Prefer `update_status` for tasks with 3+ visible steps. Use `send_temp_message` for a quick "I'm on it" with no structured progress to show.
- Plain text only — no Markdown.

---

## Tool usage: timeout strategy

**Default timeouts are optimized for minimal token usage during idle polling:**

- `wait_for_message`: 300 s (5 min) — use default when polling for next task
- `ask`, `choose`, `send_confirmation`, `wait_for_callback_query`: 60 s — reasonable wait when expecting a response

All tools support up to 300 s max. You can use shorter timeouts (e.g., 30–60 s) when you want more responsive feedback loops, or longer timeouts when idle to minimize repeated polling overhead.

Internal Telegram API long-polling uses 25 s intervals — one `wait_for_message(300)` makes ~12 API calls vs. 300+ calls with the old 1 s interval and 30 s timeout loop.

---

## Tool usage: `choose` confirmation display

When the user selects an option in `choose`, the confirmation edit uses `▸` (triangle), not ✅. This is intentional — checkmarks imply "correct" which is wrong for neutral choices.

---

## Tool usage: `set_reaction`

React to user messages instead of sending a separate acknowledgement text. Common conventions:

- 👍 — confirmed / noted
- 🫡 — task complete / will do
- 👀 — seen / noted without full ack
- 🎉 — success / great news
- 🙏 — thank you
- 👌 — OK / all good
- 🥰 — love it (for particularly nice feedback)

---

## Button label length limits (`choose`)

Telegram buttons are cut off on mobile above a certain width:

- **2-column layout (default):** max 20 chars per label — enforced with `BUTTON_LABEL_TOO_LONG` error
- **1-column layout (`columns=1`):** max 35 chars per label — enforced with `BUTTON_LABEL_TOO_LONG` error

Keep labels short and descriptive. Use `columns=1` for longer option text. Both limits are enforced server-side with a `BUTTON_LABEL_TOO_LONG` error.

---

## Formatting: default parse_mode

`send_message`, `notify`, `edit_message_text`, and `send_photo` all default to `"Markdown"`.
Standard Markdown (bold, italic, code, links, headings) is auto-converted to Telegram MarkdownV2. No manual escaping needed.

See the `formatting-guide` resource (`telegram-bridge-mcp://formatting-guide`) for the full reference.

---

## Formatting: newlines in body parameters

XML/MCP tool parameter values do **not** auto-decode `\n` escape sequences — they arrive as the literal two characters `\` + `n`. `markdownToV2()` normalises these to real newlines before processing, so `\n` in a body/text parameter will always render as a line break.

Do not use `\\n` (double backslash) — that would produce a visible backslash in the output.

---

## Voice message handling

All message-receiving tools (`wait_for_message`, `ask`, `choose`, `get_updates`, `get_update`) support voice messages with automatic transcription via local Whisper. While transcribing, a `✍` reaction is applied to the voice message; when done, it swaps to `🫡`.

Transcription is transparent — returned as `text` with `voice: true` in the result.

### Sending voice: `send_message` vs `send_voice`

| Tool | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `send_message(voice: true)` | **Speak a text response via TTS.** The text is synthesized to speech and sent as a voice note. Requires `TTS_HOST` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Use this to reply in audio. |
| `send_voice(voice: <file>)` | **Send an existing audio file.** Accepts a local OGG/Opus file path, public URL, or Telegram `file_id`. Use this when you already have audio to deliver. |

Never call `send_voice` to speak text — it only accepts pre-existing audio files.

### TTS delivery error: "user restricted receiving of voice note messages"

If `send_message` (or `send_voice`) returns:

```text
Bad Request: user restricted receiving of voice note messages
```

This is a **Telegram account privacy setting** on the user's personal account — not a bot or server issue. The synthesis worked; Telegram blocked delivery.

**Root cause:** The user's Voice Messages privacy is set to "Nobody" (or "My Contacts") without the bot in the exceptions list.

**Fix — guide the user to add the bot as an Agent exception:**

> Telegram → Settings → Privacy and Security → Voice Messages → Add Exceptions → **Always Allow** → add this bot.

Step by step on mobile:

1. Open Telegram → Settings (gear icon)
2. Privacy and Security → Voice Messages
3. Tap **Add Exceptions** → **Always Allow**
4. Search for the bot by name and add it

On desktop: same path — Settings → Privacy and Security → Voice Messages → Add Exceptions → Always Allow → select the bot.

The base setting ("Nobody", "My Contacts", etc.) can stay as-is. Adding the bot to the **Always Allow** exceptions list is sufficient.

Once the exception is added, retry the voice send — no server restart needed.

---

## Reactions from the user

`DEFAULT_ALLOWED_UPDATES` includes `"message_reaction"` so user reactions come through.

- `wait_for_message` returns a `reactions[]` array alongside each message, containing any `message_reaction` updates seen during the polling window. Never silently loses reactions.
- `get_updates` returns `{ type: "message_reaction", message_id, user, emoji_added, emoji_removed }` for reaction updates.

Use this to acknowledge what the user reacted to and adapt behavior accordingly.

---

## Received file handling

When `wait_for_message` or `get_updates` returns a message with a non-text `type`, **always ask the user what to do — never read or process the file automatically.**

React with 👀 immediately on receipt, then use `choose` with inferred action buttons based on file type.

### Core rule: always ask first, download only when needed

Do **not** call `download_file` until the user has selected an action that requires it. The metadata returned by `wait_for_message` (file name, MIME type, size) is sufficient to ask the question — no download needed to present the choice.

Never silently download, read, or process a received file without explicit instruction. The user may have sent it for a purpose you can't know — always confirm intent first.

### Handling batched file uploads

Users may send multiple files at once (e.g., drag-drop in Telegram desktop). The server processes one message at a time, so each file arrives as a separate `wait_for_message` result.

**No special handling needed** — just process each file and return to the loop. The next `wait_for_message` call will naturally pick up the next queued file.

Do **not** call `get_updates` between files — it advances the offset and can consume queued messages before the loop reaches them.

**Format for the `choose` prompt:**

- State what arrived: file name, type, size (if available)
- Offer 2–4 relevant actions as buttons, inferred from the file type
- Always include a free-text escape: ask `ask` after `choose` if the user selects "Other"

**Example — receiving `report.xlsx`:**

```text
Received report.xlsx (Excel spreadsheet, 42 KB).
What would you like me to do with it?
[Download & parse]  [Save to disk]
[Describe it]       [Nothing]
```

**Example — receiving `logo.png` (photo):**

```text
Received a photo (800×600, 50 KB).
What would you like me to do with it?
[Save to disk]  [Nothing]
```

### Inferred button sets by file type

| Type | Inferred buttons |
| --- | --- |
| `.txt .md .log .csv .env .yaml .json .xml` (text) | `Read it`, `Save to disk`, `Nothing` |
| `.ts .js .py .go` etc (source code) | `Read it`, `Apply to project`, `Save to disk`, `Nothing` |
| `.xlsx .ods .xls` (spreadsheet) | `Download & parse`, `Save to disk`, `Nothing` |
| `.docx .pptx .odt` (office doc) | `Download it`, `Save to disk`, `Nothing` |
| `.zip .tar .gz .7z` (archive) | `Download it`, `Extract contents`, `Nothing` |
| `.pdf` | `Download it`, `Save to disk`, `Nothing` |
| Photo / image | `Save to disk`, `Nothing` |
| Audio / video | `Download it`, `Nothing` |
| Sticker | _(react with the sticker emoji; no action needed)_ |
| Unknown | `Download it`, `Describe it`, `Nothing` |

Labels must respect `choose` button length limits (≤20 chars for 2-col, ≤35 for 1-col).

### After the user chooses

Act based on the selected option:

- **Read it / parse** → Call `download_file` → read `text` (if returned) and report.
- **Save to disk** → Call `download_file` → confirm saved (don't announce full path).
- **Download it** → Call `download_file` → confirm saved (don't announce full path).
- **Extract contents** → Call `download_file` → unzip/extract using available tools.
- **Apply to project** → Call `download_file` → read text, then ask where/how to apply it.
- **Describe it** → No download needed. Describe using metadata already in hand: name, size, MIME, inferred type.
- **Nothing** → Acknowledge and move on. No download.

### Downloading files

Use the `download_file` tool with the `file_id` from the received message. It returns:

- `local_path` — absolute path to the downloaded file on disk
- `file_name` — original filename
- `mime_type` — detected MIME type
- `file_size` — bytes
- `text` — file contents (only for text-based files under 100 KB)

### Never silently discard received files

Always acknowledge receipt. Even for stickers or types you can't process, confirm you saw it.

---

## Tool usage: session recording

Session recording is opt-in, in-memory, and agent-controlled. Use it when you need to review, summarize, or export updates from the current session.

**The four tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `start_session_recording(max_updates?)` | Begin capturing updates. Resets any existing buffer. Default 50 updates, max 500. |
| `get_session_updates(messages?, oldest_first?)` | Retrieve buffered updates as structured objects. Newest-first by default. |
| `dump_session_record(clean?, stop?)` | Export entire buffer as a formatted text log. `clean=true` clears buffer; `stop=true` also stops recording. |
| `cancel_session_recording()` | Stop recording and **discard** the buffer. Call `dump_session_record` or `get_session_updates` first if you need the data. |

**Key rules:**

- Recording is **off by default** — call `start_session_recording` to opt in.
- `cancel_session_recording` discards the buffer. Always export first if the data matters.
- `dump_session_record(stop: true)` is the idiomatic end-of-session call — it exports, stops, and clears in one step.
- The buffer is in-memory only. It does not persist across server restarts.
- The buffer is a ring — oldest entries are evicted when `max_updates` is reached.

See `SESSION-RECORDING.md` for full documentation and workflow examples.

---

## Restart flow

After calling `restart_server` (or the server restarts for any reason):

1. Call `get_updates` once (limit 100, timeout 0) to drain stale messages — discard everything
2. Send a "back online" message via `notify` describing what changed
3. Return to `wait_for_message` loop
