# [Unreleased]

## v7.2.0 — Unreleased

### Added

- `POST /event` endpoint: external event system for cross-participant lifecycle signaling. Any participant POSTs `{ kind, actor_sid?, details? }` with a session token; the bridge logs the event to `data/events.ndjson`, fans out an `agent_event` service message to all active sessions, and triggers kind-mapped animations for governor actors (`compacting` → `working` preset; `compacted` → cancels active animation immediately). Strict kind allow-list: `compacting`, `compacted`, `startup`, `shutdown_warn`, `shutdown_complete` — unknown kinds return 400. `help(topic: 'events')` for full reference.
- `action(type: "react")` emoji alias fallback: when an emoji Telegram does not support as a reaction is requested, the bridge remaps to a semantically similar supported emoji (`👂→👀`, `🤚→👍`, `🧠→🤔`, `👁→👀`, `🦻→👀`), applies the reaction, and returns `hint: "emoji_alias_applied"` with the substituted emoji. Unmapped unsupported emojis still return `REACTION_EMOJI_INVALID`.
- `send(type: "choice")` callback two-stage UX: on button tap, the chosen button highlights (primary style, all others reset to default) for ~500 ms, then the keyboard collapses and the message updates with the standard selection suffix — provides visual confirmation before auto-collapse.

- `response_format: "compact"` parameter added to `dequeue`, `send`, `ask`, `choose`, `confirm`, and `send_new_checklist`: suppresses always-inferrable fields (e.g. `empty: true` on empty polls, `timed_out: false` on answered prompts, `split: true`/`split_count` on multi-chunk sends) to reduce per-call response size — estimated savings of ~445 tokens per session; `timed_out: true` is always emitted in compact mode so timeout detection remains unambiguous

### Changed

- `send` audio default: TTS sends with `audio` param are now **async by default** — returns `message_id_pending` + `status: queued` immediately; result delivered via `dequeue` `send_callback` event. Pass `async: false` to opt back into synchronous behavior. Non-audio sends unchanged (task 10-820).

### Fixed

- `send(type: "question", choose: [...])`: inline keyboard is now removed in the same edit that records the answer; previously the keyboard remained visible and tappable after selection, allowing stale taps to re-fire against an already-resolved question.
- `hook-animation.ts`: updated import path for `handleShowAnimation` from removed `tools/show_animation.ts` to `tools/animation/show.ts`
- `hook-animation.test.ts` / `hook-animation.integration.test.ts`: updated mock and `importActual` paths to match the new module location; fixed `no-confusing-void-expression` lint errors in `server.close` callbacks
- `tools/acknowledge/query.test.ts`, `tools/message/delete.test.ts`: removed unused `parseResult` imports
- `tools/send.test.ts`: added `async: false` to four audio-path response_format tests that were routing to the async/queued path instead of the synchronous path
- Async voice send now shows the Telegram recording indicator continuously across batched audio jobs to the same chat (per-chat refcount in `async-send-queue.ts`); typing emission is suppressed while audio is in flight via new `pauseTypingEmission` / `resumeTypingEmission` API in `typing-state.ts`; sync voice path also participates via `acquireRecordingIndicator` / `releaseRecordingIndicator` in `tools/send.ts`; 120 s safety bound force-clears stuck indicators

## v6.0.2 — 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Replaced legacy tool name references (`session_start`, `list_sessions`, `save_profile`, `list_reminders`) in all user-facing error/recovery strings with v6 `action()` dispatcher paths

- `src/tools/help.ts`: `startup` topic — token line now says "Required for all session-bound calls" (was "Required for all calls"); `message/history` example now includes `count: 20`
- `src/tools/help.test.ts`: Added test coverage for `startup` topic
- `src/tools/session_start.test.ts`: Section comment updated from "instructions field" to "hint field"
- `src/reauth-dismiss.test.ts`: Added `afterEach` hook reset to prevent cross-test auth hook leak
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Downgraded `pnpm/action-setup` v6→v4; added `version: "10.0.0"` to pin pnpm exactly (v6 failed with `ERR_PNPM_BROKEN_LOCKFILE` on valid lockfiles)

## v6.0.1 — 2026-04-10

### Added

- Reauth dialog auto-dismiss: when a session has a pending reconnect approval dialog and a subsequent tool call succeeds with a valid token, the dialog is automatically deleted (task 30-475)

### Fixed

- `src/reauth-dismiss.test.ts`: Corrected `vi.fn<>` generic syntax to use single function-type argument matching Vitest 2.x API (task 40-478)

## Breaking

- **v6 API surface finalized** — All v5 standalone tool registrations removed. Only `send`, `dequeue`, `help`, and `action` are now registered as MCP tools. All previous capabilities remain accessible through these 4 tools.

## Added

- `send` MCP tool — unified text/voice messaging tool replacing `send_text`, `send_message`, and `send_text_as_voice`; selects voice or text mode via `audio` parameter
- Error guidance hints — all error responses include a `hint` field with actionable next steps; unknown `type` and `action` values trigger fuzzy (Levenshtein) matching that suggests the closest valid value; `dequeue` timeout validation messages are human-readable
- `approve_agent` MCP tool — governor-only session approval; always registered but returns a `BLOCKED` error at runtime unless agent delegation is enabled
- `toggle_logging` MCP tool — enables or disables disk logging for the current session
- `delete_log` MCP tool — deletes a specific local log file by filename
- Dynamic agent approval with color assignment — sessions approved via `/approve` command or operator dialog are assigned a color from the available palette
- Animation auto-cancel — starting a new animation or sending a message automatically cancels any active animation for the session
- `help` MCP tool — API discovery tool listing all registered tools with descriptions; replaces `get_agent_guide`
- `src/tool-hooks.ts`: `buildDenyPatternHook(patterns)` — builds a pre-tool hook that blocks tool calls matching any of the provided glob patterns
- `src/tool-hooks.ts`: `invokePreToolHook(toolName, args)` — invokes a pre-tool hook; blocked calls are logged and return a deny result
- `src/server.ts`: `logBlockedToolCall(toolName, reason)` — writes a `[hook:blocked]` line to stderr when a tool call is denied
- `src/local-log.ts`: `logEvent(event)` — appends a structured JSON event record to the active session log file on disk using `appendFileSync`
- `src/local-log.ts`: `rollLog()` — archives the current session log and opens a new one
- `src/local-log.ts`: `isLoggingEnabled()` — returns whether disk logging is active
- `get_log` MCP tool — reads a local log file by filename; returns file content via MCP tool response (log content never transits Telegram); list mode (omit filename) returns `{ current_log, log_files, count }`
- `list_logs` MCP tool — lists available local log files
- `roll_log` MCP tool — archives the current session log and starts a new one

## Changed

- `send`, `confirm`, `confirmYN`, `choose` — API simplified to `text` (display) + `audio` (spoken TTS content) channels; per-message `voice` and `speed` override params removed from all tools; voice resolution uses session/global settings only; `choose` renames `question` parameter to `text`
- `dequeue_update` renamed to `dequeue`; `dequeue_update` is no longer a registered tool name
- `dequeue` (formerly `dequeue_update`) returns `{ error: "session_closed" }` when the active session is terminated during a wait
- Cold-start governor workflow fixed — first-session approval no longer requires a pre-existing session context
- Tool descriptions tightened across all registered tools to minimize per-call context usage
- Shutdown sequence now calls `rollLog()` to archive the active session log instead of the no-op `flushCurrentLog()`
- `get_log` list mode response now includes `current_log` field identifying the active session log filename
- `action(type: "chat/info")` — new action path returning chat metadata (id, type, title, username, first/last name, description) with a user confirmation prompt; previously accessible only via the v5 `get_chat` standalone tool
- `action(type: "confirm/ok")` / `action(type: "confirm/ok-cancel")` / `action(type: "confirm/yn")` — preset confirm dialogs; caller passes only `text` and `token`; preset button labels eliminate boilerplate
- `send(type: "question", options: [...])` — `options` accepted as alias for `choose` in question choose mode, aligning naming with `send(type: "choice", options: [...])`
- `profile/import` `recurring` field on reminders now defaults to `false` (was required)
- `help(topic: "checklist")` — documents valid step statuses: pending, running, done, failed, skipped
- `help(topic: "animation")` — frame guide including single-emoji sticker workaround (`\u200b` fix)
- ESLint now ignores `src/tools/_retired/**` so retired tools no longer block active code lint validation

## Fixed

- `send(type: "progress"/"checklist")` — `text` param now accepted as an alias for `title` (caption above bar/checklist); `title` takes precedence when both are provided. Previously `text` was silently ignored, rendering no caption.
- `send_new_progress` / `update_progress` — progress bar state (title, subtext, width) now persisted in `src/progress-store.ts`; `update_progress` uses stored values as defaults when caller omits them; explicit overrides update the store; empty string clears stored field; 100% completion deletes the store entry. Previously, calling `update_progress` with only `percent` erased the title and subtext.
- `/voice`, `/version`, `/session` built-in command responses no longer prepend the active session's name tag; `_skipHeader: true` added to `sendMessage` calls in those handlers. `/logging` was already correct.
- Session approval menu (`/approve`) UX: delegate toggle now edits panel in-place instead of creating new messages; toggle buttons relabeled as actions (`Enable/Disable Delegation`); all buttons given consistent emoji treatment; collapsed messages use `→ [action]` format; 10-minute mode collapse includes expiry HH:MM.
- Non-blocking `send_choice` button press now collapses the message to show `▸ *[selected label]*` with buttons removed, matching blocking `choose` behavior. Previously buttons disappeared with no feedback.
- `/session` detail panel: `Started` field now shows `HH:MM` local time instead of raw ISO string; "Set as Primary" button hidden when the selected session is already the primary (governor).
- `/log` command now aliases `/logging`; removed from bot command list. `/logging` panel "Dump" renamed to "💾 Save log", "Flush (N)" renamed to "🗑 Clear (N)"; ON-state buttons split into 2×2 layout for mobile.
- Service message visual consistency: `/logging` panel buttons all have emoji (`✓ Enable`, `✗ Disable`); flush confirm buttons get emoji; `/session` list panel gets `_skipHeader: true` and a `🖥` title emoji.
- `renderProgress()` subtext no longer force-wrapped in `<i>...</i>`; renders as plain escaped text so senders control their own formatting.
- `load_profile` / `action(type: "profile/load")`: `color_hint` field in profile now applied retroactively via `setSessionColor`; corrects mis-assigned session color after start. Only applies when the hinted color is not already held by another session. `profiles/Worker.json`, `Curator.json`, `Overseer.json` updated with `color_hint`.
- `send(type: "animation", timeout: N)` — `timeout` param was silently dropped because the schema used `animation_timeout`; animation ran for the default 600 s instead of the specified value. Renamed schema param to `timeout`.
- `action(type: "animation/default", preset: "working")` / `set_default_animation(preset: "working")` — preset param was accepted without error but fell through to read-only mode; session default was never updated. Now looks up the preset's frames and sets them as the default.
- `action(type: "log/debug", category: "animation")` — `category` schema was `z.enum(...)`, rejecting valid category strings with an unhelpful error. Changed to `z.string()` with valid values listed in the description; unknown categories produce empty results.
- `action(type: "message/edit")` without `parse_mode` — schema field was `optional()` with no default, sending messages as plain text instead of running Markdown auto-conversion. Changed to `.default("Markdown")` to match standalone `edit_message` behavior. `parse_mode` description updated to clarify that `"MarkdownV2"` is raw pass-through (manual escaping required).
- `tasks/claim.ps1` / `tasks/claim.sh` — Replaced with canonical cortex.lan versions using `git mv` for atomic claim (no `GIT_INDEX_FILE` manipulation required; index atomicity provided by `git mv`); `TaskFile` parameter is now optional (scans queue by priority if omitted); rollback via reverse `git mv` on commit failure; added `tasks/claim.spec.md` design specification
- `session_start.ts` orientation messages — removed stale `get_agent_guide` references; replaced with `help(topic: 'guide')` (tool was removed in this release)

## Removed

- `send_text` — replaced by `send`
- `send_message` — replaced by `send`
- `send_text_as_voice` — replaced by `send`
- `get_agent_guide` — removed; replace with `help` tool and `agent-guide` MCP resource
- Removed orphaned `tutorial/on` and `tutorial/off` action handlers and backing session state (`tutorialEnabled`, `tutorialSeenTools`, `isTutorialEnabled`, `setTutorialEnabled`, `markTutorialToolSeen`). The tutorial hint read path was removed by task 10-579; this cleans up the write-only remnants.

## Security

- `logBlockedToolCall` sanitizes `toolName` and `reason` fields by replacing ASCII control characters (U+0000–U+001F, U+007F) with spaces before writing to stderr, preventing log-injection attacks
- `buildDenyPatternHook` now escapes all regex metacharacters in glob patterns (including `?`, `-`, `#`, whitespace) before compiling, preventing pattern bypass via metacharacter injection
- `tasks/claim.ps1` / `tasks/claim.sh` — `GIT_INDEX_FILE` no longer referenced; atomic `git mv` eliminates shared-index exposure during claim; `docs/git-index-safety.md` updated to clarify the pattern applies to scripts using `git add`/`git rm --cached` directly, not `git mv`-based scripts

### Documentation

- Added `docs/migration-v5-to-v6.md` — complete v5→v6 tool mapping, before/after examples, breaking changes
- Updated `README.md` to reflect 4-tool v6 architecture
- Updated `docs/setup.md` to remove v5 tool name references
- Updated `docs/help/guide.md` (renamed from `docs/behavior.md`) and `LOOP-PROMPT.md` for v6 tool names
- Added `docs/git-index-safety.md` — GIT_INDEX_FILE contamination hazard, fix pattern (PowerShell and bash), and historical incident reference (task 10-429)

## Deprecated

- All v5 standalone tools (e.g. `send_text`, `ask`, `choose`, `notify`, `edit_message`, `session_start`, etc.) — fully retired; functionality available via `send`, `dequeue`, `help`, and `action`
