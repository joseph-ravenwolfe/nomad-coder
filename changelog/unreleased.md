# [Unreleased]

## Changed

- `session_start`: First session announcement is no longer pinned immediately; pinning is deferred until a second session joins.
- `session_start`: When a second session joins, the first session's announcement is retroactively pinned before the new session's announcement is pinned.
- `close_session`: When closing the penultimate session (2→1), the remaining session's announcement is now unpinned (single-session mode needs no pins).
