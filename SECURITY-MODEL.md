# Security Model

This document explains the security boundary for Telegram Bridge MCP, what is protected, what is not, and how to operate it safely. It is intentionally explicit about risk because this project exists to unlock agent capability.

---

## Executive Summary

- This server protects the Telegram boundary (who can talk to the bot, and which chat the bot can act in).
- This server does NOT protect your host environment (filesystem, shell, network, secrets) if your MCP host grants those tools to the agent.
- If you bind this server to an untrusted or unbounded agent, you can still lose data or secrets through other MCP tools.

---

## Primary Security Boundary

Telegram Bridge MCP enforces a strict, single-user / single-chat model by default:

- `ALLOWED_USER_ID` blocks inbound updates from anyone else.
- `ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` blocks outbound tool calls to any other chat, and discards inbound updates from other chats.

This prevents message injection from unknown Telegram users and prevents misdirected sends.

---

## What This Server DOES Protect

- Inbound message authenticity within Telegram (only the configured user is accepted).
- Outbound message targeting (only the configured chat is allowed).
- Telegram API errors are surfaced as structured errors with clear remediation.

---

## What This Server DOES NOT Protect

These risks are outside this server and must be handled by your MCP host and agent policies:

- Filesystem access (read, write, delete) if the agent can run shell tools or file tools.
- System access (process execution, package installs, environment secrets).
- Network access beyond Telegram (curl, HTTP clients, arbitrary endpoints).
- Data exfiltration through other MCP tools (e.g., reading local files and sending them elsewhere).

If your MCP host provides any of those capabilities to the agent, the safety boundary is no longer the Telegram bot. It is the host policy.

---

## Operational Guidance (Recommended)

Use these controls at the MCP host level when you care about safety:

- Do not grant shell or filesystem tools to untrusted or unbound agents.
- Use allow-lists for tools and directories.
- Require explicit user confirmation for destructive actions (delete, overwrite, network sends).
- Run the agent in a sandboxed account or container when possible.
- Keep `ALLOWED_USER_ID` and `ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` set at all times.

---

## File Handling Risk

This server can send and receive files (local path or URL). That is a capability, not a sandbox:

- Local paths can expose secrets if an agent is allowed to read them.
- URL fetches can be used to access internal resources if the host network allows it.

Treat file tools as privileged operations and gate them accordingly in your MCP host.

## Threat Model Summary

| Threat | Mitigated Here | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stranger messages the bot | Yes | `ALLOWED_USER_ID` filter |
| Agent sends to wrong chat | Yes | `ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` filter |
| Destructive local actions | No | Host-level tool policy |
| Secret exfiltration | No | Host-level tool policy |
| Arbitrary network access | No | Host-level tool policy |

## Recommended Disclosure (Short Form)

This project secures the Telegram boundary, not your host. If your MCP host grants the agent shell, filesystem, or network tools, those risks are outside this server. Use host-level allow-lists, confirmations, or sandboxing when needed.
