# Telegram Bridge MCP — Design Document

**Telegram Bridge MCP** is a Model Context Protocol server that bridges AI assistants to a Telegram bot for two-way communication: messaging, confirmations, status updates, and voice transcription.

  Telegram Bot API
  api.telegram.org/bot<token>/...
```

The server runs as a **stdio MCP server**, spawned by the MCP host. It holds a Telegram Bot token (via environment variable) and translates MCP tool calls into Telegram Bot API HTTP requests using **`grammy`** — chosen for its complete, always-up-to-date TypeScript-typed Bot API coverage including all keyboard/button types.

A **background poller** (`poller.ts`) runs a continuous `getUpdates` long-poll loop as soon as the server starts. All incoming updates are fed into an always-on **message store** (`message-store.ts`). Tools consume updates via `dequeue_update` — they never call the Telegram API directly for polling.

## Configuration

| Variable           | Required    | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BOT_TOKEN`        | Yes         | Telegram Bot API token from @BotFather                                                        |
| `ALLOWED_USER_ID`  | Recommended | Numeric Telegram user ID; inbound updates from others are dropped; also the outbound chat target |

Set via environment variable, or a `.env` file (loaded with `dotenv`).

---

## Tool Catalogue

Tools are grouped by abstraction level.

### High-level tools (use these first)

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `get_agent_guide` | Returns BEHAVIOR.md — the behavioral guide for this server. Call at session start. |
| `set_topic` | Sets a default title prepended to all outbound messages as `[Title]`. Useful when multiple VS Code windows share the same Telegram chat — each process labels its messages so you can tell which agent sent what. Pass empty string to clear. Scoped to this server process. |
| `notify` | Sends a titled, severity-coded notification with optional body. Supports silent delivery. |
| `ask` | Sends a question and blocks until the user replies with free text or voice. |
| `choose` | Sends a question with labeled inline keyboard buttons; blocks until a button is pressed or the user replies with text/voice. |
| `send_confirmation` | Sends a Yes/No inline keyboard and blocks until a button is pressed. Returns `{ confirmed: true \| false }`, or `{ timed_out: true }` if the timeout expires without input. |
| `update_status` | Creates or edits a live task checklist message with per-step status indicators. |

### Polling & message retrieval

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dequeue_update` | **Universal update consumption.** Blocks up to `timeout` seconds when the queue is empty. Returns the next update as `{ id, event, from, content, pending? }`. The response lane (reactions, callbacks) drains before the message lane. Voice messages arrive pre-transcribed. Returns `{ empty: true }` when no update is available within the timeout. |
| `get_message` | Random-access lookup of a stored message by ID with optional version history. Returns text, caption, file metadata, and edit history. Only call for message IDs already known to this agent session. |

### Messaging

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `send_text` | Sends a text message. Supports Markdown (default, auto-converted), MarkdownV2, HTML. Messages over 4096 chars are automatically split. |
| `send_text_as_voice` | Synthesizes text to speech and sends it as a voice note. Requires `TTS_HOST` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`. All Markdown is stripped before synthesis. |
| `send_file` | Sends a file (photo, document, video, audio, or voice) by local path, HTTPS URL, or Telegram `file_id`. Type is auto-detected by extension. |
| `edit_message_text` | Edits the text of a previously sent message. |
| `append_text` | Delta-appends a chunk to an existing message in-place. O(1) token cost per call. |
| `download_file` | Downloads a received file to local disk by `file_id`. Returns text content for text-based files under 100 KB. |
| `transcribe_voice` | Re-transcribes a voice message by `file_id`. Use when transcription failed or the result needs to be fetched again. |
| `delete_message` | Deletes a message by ID. |
| `pin_message` | Pins or unpins a message. Pass `unpin: true` to unpin; omit `message_id` with `unpin: true` to unpin the most recent. |
| `send_chat_action` | Sends a one-shot action indicator (typing, upload_photo, etc.) that lasts ~5 s. |
| `show_typing` | Idempotent sustained typing indicator — starts or extends a looping interval. Pass `cancel: true` to stop immediately. |

### Visual (animations)

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `show_animation` | Starts a cycling placeholder message with configurable frames and interval. Single frame = static placeholder. Auto-cancels on timeout. |
| `cancel_animation` | Stops the active animation. Without `text`: deletes the placeholder. With `text`: edits it into a permanent message. |

### Interaction primitives

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `answer_callback_query` | Dismisses the loading spinner after an inline button press. Must be called within 30 s of receiving the callback. |

### Bot / chat info

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `get_me` | Returns basic information about the bot (id, username, capabilities). |
| `get_chat` | Returns information about the configured chat. Requires operator approval via a consent button before any PII is returned. |
| `set_commands` | Registers (or clears) the Telegram slash-command menu for the active chat or globally. Pass `[]` to remove the menu. Commands are automatically cleared on shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT, `restart_server`) so stale menu options never linger. |

### Reactions

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `set_reaction` | Sets an emoji reaction on a message. Supports semantic aliases (`thinking`, `done`, `salute`, etc.) and raw emoji. |

### Session

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dump_session_record` | Returns the full conversation timeline as compact JSON — all inbound and outbound events since server start (rolling 1000-event limit). Call only when the operator explicitly requests session history. |

### Server management

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `restart_server` | Exits the process cleanly; VS Code restarts it automatically to pick up new builds. |

---

## MCP Resources

Five Markdown documents are exposed as MCP resources and via `get_agent_guide`:

| URI | File | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `telegram-bridge-mcp://agent-guide` | `BEHAVIOR.md` | Behavioral guide: personality, tool conventions, formatting rules |
| `telegram-bridge-mcp://communication-guide` | `COMMUNICATION.md` | Tool selection, commit/push flow, loop rules, and multi-step task patterns |
| `telegram-bridge-mcp://quick-reference` | `.github/instructions/telegram-communication.instructions.md` | Hard rules + tool selection table — compact injected rules card |
| `telegram-bridge-mcp://setup-guide` | `SETUP.md` | Step-by-step setup guide for new users |
| `telegram-bridge-mcp://formatting-guide` | `FORMATTING.md` | Markdown/MarkdownV2/HTML formatting reference |

---

## Error Handling

All Telegram API errors are caught and returned as structured MCP tool errors:

```ts
{
  code: TelegramErrorCode,   // e.g. "MESSAGE_TOO_LONG", "RATE_LIMITED"
  message: string,           // Human-readable description with remediation hint
  retry_after?: number,      // Seconds to wait (RATE_LIMITED only)
  raw?: string               // Raw Telegram error description for debugging
}
```

Pre-send validators run before hitting the API for text length, caption length, and callback data byte size. `send_text` auto-splits texts over 4096 chars rather than rejecting them. All outbound API calls use a `callApi()` wrapper that automatically retries on Telegram 429 rate-limit responses (waits `retry_after` seconds, up to 3 retries). Missing `BOT_TOKEN` at startup causes an immediate fatal exit with a clear message to stderr.

---

## Formatting

All tools that send text default to `parse_mode: "Markdown"`. The server auto-converts standard Markdown syntax to Telegram MarkdownV2 — no manual escaping needed.

Explicit `parse_mode: "MarkdownV2"` and `parse_mode: "HTML"` are also supported for full control.

See `FORMATTING.md` (or the `telegram-bridge-mcp://formatting-guide` resource) for the full reference.

## Key Design Decisions

**Single-user by design.** The server is locked to one `ALLOWED_USER_ID` via config, which also serves as the outbound chat target (for private bots, chat.id === user.id). Tools do not accept `chat_id` parameters — the target is resolved transparently. This eliminates an entire class of misdirected-message bugs and simplifies tool signatures.

**Polling over webhooks.** The server uses long-polling (up to 55 s timeout). No public URL, no TLS cert, no webhook registration required. Works out of the box behind NAT and in local development.

**Background poller with message store.** A single background `getUpdates` loop runs continuously (started in `index.ts`) and feeds all updates into an always-on message store (`message-store.ts`). Tools consume from the store via `dequeue_update` — no tool-level long-polling against the Telegram API. This separates update ingestion from update consumption and enables voice pre-transcription, random-access message lookup, and reliable queuing.

**`dequeue_update` is the sole update-consumption tool.** It replaces the former `get_update`, `get_updates`, and `wait_for_message` tools. The response lane (reactions, callbacks) drains before the message lane on each call. `pending` tells the agent how many more items are queued.

**Structured errors over exceptions.** All Telegram API errors are classified into typed `TelegramErrorCode` values with actionable messages. The assistant can branch on `code` rather than parsing raw error strings.
