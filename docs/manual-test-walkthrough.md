# Manual Regression Test Suite

Reusable manual test plan for the Nomad Coder server. Run through these scenarios after any significant change to verify core functionality.

**Notation:**

- **[Agent]** = agent calls MCP tool
- **[Op]** = operator action on Telegram
- **[Verify]** = expected outcome to confirm

## Prerequisites

1. `npm run build` — clean
2. `npm run lint` — clean
3. `npm test` — all passing
4. Restart the MCP server (`shutdown()` → call any tool to restart)
5. `action(type: "session/start")` — fresh session (SID 1)
6. `action(type: "profile/topic", topic: "🧪 Test")` with a test label

## Part B — Multi-Session Tests

> Requires 2+ MCP clients connected simultaneously.
> See `docs/multi-session-test-script.md` for the full multi-session test plan.

### B1. Session Lifecycle

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1.1 | [S1] already connected → [S2] `action(type: "session/start", name: "Scout")` | S2 gets SID 2, `sessions_active: 2`, `fellow_sessions` lists S1 |

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B2.1 | [S1] `send(type: "text", text: "I'm S1")` → [Op] replies | Only S1 receives reply (`routing: "targeted"`) |

| B3.3 | [S1] `action(type: "session/close")` → [Op] sends plain message | S2 (now governor) receives it |

### B4. DM Permissions

### B5. Health Check

| Step | Action | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |

| B5.2 | Governor resumes polling | "Session is back online" notification |

---

## Known Issues

- **`get_chat` timeout**: The 60-second approval prompt may time out before the operator can respond. The `pollButtonPress` mechanism may have a race condition with session-queue routing. Tracked for investigation.
