# Telegram Communication Guide

All agent communication goes through Telegram. The operator is on their phone — not watching the agent panel.

## Hard Rules

1. **`send_confirmation`** — all yes/no questions. Always buttons.
2. **`choose`** — all multi-option questions. Always buttons.
3. **`dequeue_update`** — all update waiting. Blocks up to timeout with `pending` count.
4. **`reply_to_message_id`** — include on every reply to thread messages visually.
5. **Commit/push** — get explicit operator approval first. Send a `notify` summary before committing.
6. **`show_typing`** — call when you are actively composing a reply. This is the "I'm about to respond" signal — not a generic receipt acknowledgement. It tells the operator a response is imminent.
7. **React 👀 immediately on receive.** The moment a message arrives, `set_reaction(👀)` — this is the first action, before any processing. Update to 🫡 (acknowledged) or 👍 (task complete) when done. Never leave 👀 without resolving it.
8. **Drain before you speak** — before sending any message, drain pending updates with `dequeue_update(timeout=0)` until empty. Never talk over the operator; always hear them out first. Responding without draining makes it look like you dismissed what they said. When `pending > 0`, show a typing indicator while continuing to drain — the operator can see you're reading through their messages.

## Tool Selection

| Situation | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Pure statement / preference | React (🫡 👍 👀 ❤) — no text reply |
| Yes/No decision | `send_confirmation` |
| Fixed options | `choose` |
| Open-ended input | `ask` |
| Short status (1–2 sentences) | `notify` |
| Ephemeral placeholder ("Thinking…") | `show_animation` / `cancel_animation` |
| Structured result / explanation | `send_text` (Markdown) |
| Build / deploy / error event | `notify` with severity |
| Multi-step task (3+ steps) | `update_status` checklist |

---

## Reactions

```txt
👀 = I'm processing this right now (set IMMEDIATELY on receive — the "eyes are on it" signal)
🫡 = got it / acknowledged / understood (receipt of a simple statement or instruction)
👍 = task complete / confirmed done
❤  = great / love it
```

**Lifecycle pattern:** React 👀 the moment you receive a message — this is the first thing you do, before any processing. Once you've responded or completed work, update the reaction to 🫡 (acknowledgement) or 👍 (task done). This gives the operator a live status indicator: 👀 = still in progress, resolved emoji = done.

`show_typing` = I'm composing a reply right now — use this when a text response is imminent, not as a generic "received" signal. The order should be: receive → 👀 reaction → do work → `show_typing` → send reply → update reaction to 🫡/👍.

## Message Formatting

- `*bold*` for headers and key terms
- `` `code` `` for commands, paths, values
- ` ``` ` for command output / config snippets
- Always thread replies with `reply_to_message_id`

---

## Commit → Push Flow

1. `notify` summary (silent) before committing.
2. Review every `.md` file touched during the session — fix any markdown warnings, broken links, inconsistent heading levels, trailing spaces, or formatting issues, however trivial.
3. Commit.
4. Edit the notify message to add a `↑ Push` button.
5. `dequeue_update` — wait for operator tap (callback query).
6. `answer_callback_query` to dismiss spinner.
7. Send `notify` "Pushing…" (save message_id).
8. Remove the button from step 4.
9. Push.
10. Edit "Pushing…" in-place → "✅ Pushed `sha` → `main`".

---

## Multi-Step Tasks

Use `update_status` for any task with 3+ steps.

```txt
msg = update_status(title, steps: [{label, status: "running"}, ...])
pin_message(msg.message_id, disable_notification: true)
# ... update after each step ...
unpin_message(msg.message_id)
```

Status values: `pending` · `running` · `done` · `failed` · `skipped`

---

## Pinned Messages

Pin for: live task checklists, session state, important reference during complex work.  
Always `disable_notification: true`. Unpin when content is no longer relevant.

---

## Loop

Call `dequeue_update` again after every task, timeout, or error — loop forever.  
Only `exit` from the operator ends the loop.  
When unsure whether to stop, ask via Telegram and wait for the operator's answer.

On timeout (`{ timed_out: true }`): call `dequeue_update` again immediately. Normal idle behavior.

---

## Session End

1. Send `notify` (severity: "success") summarizing what was done and what's pending.
2. Confirm all items are saved/committed as needed.
