reactions — Reaction protocol for agent sessions.

Reactions are acknowledgments, not action triggers. Never mutate state from a reaction.

## Emoji semantics

| Emoji | Meaning | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 👌 | Weakest ack — "received, no commitment" | Message noted; not committing to action |
| 👍 | Strong ack — "received, will do" | Committing to act on this message |
| 🫡 | Auto-salute — auto-fired on voice dequeue | Do not send manually; override only to convey meaning beyond receipt |
| ❤️+ | Reserved for meaning | High-valence reactions; use sparingly and only when the emotion is real |

Common drift: confusing 👌 with 🆗 (regional indicator); using 👍 as the default/weakest ack. 👌 is weakest; 👍 commits.

## Voice vs. text

- **Voice messages** are auto-saluted on dequeue with 🫡. Override only when you need to convey additional meaning (e.g. `react(preset: "processing")` during long work).
- **Text messages** get no automatic reaction beyond the implicit base — call `react(...)` when an ack is useful.

## Presets

- `react(preset: "processing")` — voice-work idiom. Fires 👀 (eyeballs, priority 1, auto-clears after 10s) + 🤔 (thinking, priority 0, clears on next outbound action). Use on dequeue of an audio message; both layers vanish once you respond.

## Priority queue

- Only the highest-priority reaction is visible at any time; lower-priority reactions surface when the top one clears or expires.
- An implicit base reaction 👌 is inserted at priority -100 on first reaction per message — ensures the bot never leaves a message reaction-less.
- When all higher layers clear, the base becomes visible.

## Temporality

- Some emojis are temporary by default: 🤔, 👀, ⏳, ✍, 👨‍💻. They auto-revert on the next outbound action from your session.
- All other emojis are permanent by default.
- Pass `temporary: true` to force auto-revert, or `temporary: false` to pin a normally-temporary emoji. Explicit always wins.

## Unsupported emoji fallback

Some emoji are commonly used by agents but are not accepted by Telegram as reactions (e.g. 👂 ear, 🤚 raised hand, 🧠 brain, 👁 single eye, 🦻 ear with hearing aid). Rather than failing, the bridge remaps these to the closest supported semantic equivalent and returns a hint:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "temporary": true,
  "hint": "emoji_alias_applied",
  "hint_detail": "👂 is not a supported Telegram reaction. Used 👀 (closest semantic alias). The fallback uses the same temporality rules as the alias target directly."
}
```

The response also includes standard fields from the normal routing path such as `temporary`, `restore_emoji`, and `timeout_seconds`, reflecting the actual routing taken after substitution.

This applies to the single-emoji path only. The alias target is substituted and then routed normally — including `temporary`, `timeout_seconds`, and TEMPORARY_BY_DEFAULT rules. Unknown unsupported emoji (with no semantic mapping) still return `REACTION_EMOJI_INVALID`.

## Constraints

- **DMs**: no reactions, no typing indicators, no animations — DMs are a pure data channel.
- **Single emoji in a text message** renders as a Telegram sticker, not a message. Use multi-character content (e.g. `👌 done`) when you need a text reply.
