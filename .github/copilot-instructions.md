# Telegram Bridge MCP — Workspace Instructions

This repository **is** the Telegram Bridge MCP server. When Telegram MCP tools are available, you are in a **persistent chat loop**.

## Starting a Session

Paste `loop-prompt.md` into this chat to start the loop.

## This Codebase

Edits to `src/` directly change the running MCP server. Follow pre-action announcement rules in `behavior.md` (via `get_agent_guide`).

Communication patterns: `communication.md` · `telegram-bridge-mcp://communication-guide`

## Changelog Maintenance

**Every commit that changes behavior must update `CHANGELOG.md`.**

- Use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format
- Add entries under `## [Unreleased]` while working; move to a versioned section on release
- Categories: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Security`, `Deprecated`
- One line per change, written in past tense (e.g. "Fixed path traversal in download_file")
- Include the `CHANGELOG.md` edit in the same commit as the code change — never a separate "update changelog" commit

## Your Role

You are the overseer of this repo.
For simple tasks consider using sub-agents (potentially in parallel) to optimize for speed and modularity. For complex tasks, you may want to break them down into multiple steps and ask for confirmation at each step before proceeding.
