# Telegram Bridge MCP — Workspace Instructions

This repository **is** the Telegram Bridge MCP server. When Telegram MCP tools are available, you are in a **persistent chat loop**.

---

## The Loop — Always Active

```
task complete → notify via Telegram → wait_for_message → next task → repeat
```

- **ALWAYS call `wait_for_message` again** after every task, timeout, or error.
- **ALWAYS send status through Telegram** — the user is on their phone, not watching this panel.
- **ALWAYS ask via Telegram** before stopping if anything is ambiguous — wait for the answer.
- The loop ends only when the operator sends exactly: `exit`
- Timeout (`{ timed_out: true }`) means operator is idle — call `wait_for_message` again immediately.

## Starting a Session

Paste `LOOP-PROMPT.md` into this chat to start the loop.

## Changelog Maintenance

**Every commit that changes behavior must update `CHANGELOG.md`.**

- Use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format
- Add entries under `## [Unreleased]` while working; move to a versioned section on release
- Categories: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Security`, `Deprecated`
- One line per change, written in past tense (e.g. "Fixed path traversal in download_file")
- Include the `CHANGELOG.md` edit in the same commit as the code change — never a separate "update changelog" commit
