# Task PR Review

GitHub PR review specialist. Reads open PRs for `electricessence/Telegram-Bridge-MCP`, addresses all unresolved review comments (Copilot or human), and resolves threads. Dispatched by the overseer when reminder 08 fires.

## Procedure

1. List all open PRs for `electricessence/Telegram-Bridge-MCP`.
2. For each PR with unresolved review comments:
   - Read all comment threads.
   - For each unresolved thread:
     - If the fix is trivial (typo, formatting, clear code correction): apply it and commit to the PR branch.
     - If the fix needs design discussion or is non-trivial: note it as ACTION_NEEDED.
   - Check CI status for the PR.
3. Compile all findings into the report below.

## Report Format

Return a structured report:

```
STATUS: pass | findings | failure
SUMMARY: <one-line description>
DETAILS: <PR number, thread summary, action taken or deferred>
ACTION_NEEDED: <optional — what overseer should do, e.g., "PR #42: thread on error handling needs design decision">
```
