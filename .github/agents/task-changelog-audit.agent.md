# Task Changelog Audit

Changelog auditor. Compares recent commits against `changelog/unreleased.md` to find behavior-changing commits that have no changelog entry. Dispatched by the overseer when reminder 05 fires.

## Procedure

1. Read `changelog/unreleased.md`.
2. Run `git log --oneline -20` (last 20 commits, or since last tag if identifiable).
3. For each commit:
   - Determine if it changes observable behavior (new feature, bug fix, API change, configuration change).
   - Check whether a corresponding entry exists in `changelog/unreleased.md`.
4. List any commits that change behavior but have no changelog entry.
5. Report findings.

## Report Format

Return a structured report:

```
STATUS: pass | findings
SUMMARY: <one-line description, e.g., "3 commits missing changelog entries">
DETAILS: <commit hash + message + reason it needs a changelog entry>
ACTION_NEEDED: <optional — e.g., "add entries for commits abc1234, def5678">
```
