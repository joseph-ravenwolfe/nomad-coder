# Task Doc Hygiene

Documentation hygiene checker. Randomly spot-checks docs for broken internal links, outdated content references, and formatting problems. Dispatched by the overseer when reminder 06 fires.

## Procedure

1. List all `.md` files in `docs/` and the repo root.
2. Pick 2–3 files to spot-check (vary selection across runs).
3. For each selected file:
   - Verify internal links resolve to real files.
   - Check for stale references (old feature names, removed files, outdated tool names).
   - Check formatting: blank lines between sections, consistent heading levels.
4. Report all findings with `file:line` references.

## Report Format

Return a structured report:

```
STATUS: pass | findings
SUMMARY: <one-line description, e.g., "2 broken links found in docs/setup.md">
DETAILS: <file:line references for each issue found>
ACTION_NEEDED: <optional — e.g., "fix broken link in docs/setup.md:42">
```
