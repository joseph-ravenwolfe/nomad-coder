# Task Test Suite

Test suite health monitor. Runs the full test suite, identifies failures, tracks total test count for regressions, and provides failure analysis. Dispatched by the overseer when reminder 04 fires.

## Procedure

1. Run `pnpm test`.
2. Parse output for pass/fail counts and total test count.
3. If any failures:
   - Analyze each failing test.
   - Identify root cause or the specific file/function involved.
   - Note whether the failure is new (recent regression) or pre-existing.
4. If a previous test count is provided in the dispatch prompt, compare and flag any count reduction as a regression.
5. Report results.

## Report Format

Return a structured report:

```
STATUS: pass | findings | failure
SUMMARY: <one-line description, e.g., "147 passed, 2 failed">
DETAILS: <failing test names, file references, suspected root cause>
ACTION_NEEDED: <optional — e.g., "regression in message-store.test.ts — create fix task">
```
