## ⚠️ Pre-Flight Rejection

**All acceptance criteria already satisfied in `3f527e9` (dev HEAD).**

Commit `5a33435` ("chore: hygiene fixes from Copilot review round 2") already updated the `getAvailableColors` JSDoc. The current JSDoc (lines 105–115 of `src/session-manager.ts`) reads:

> "If `hint` is a valid palette color that is **not currently in use**, it is moved to the far left..."

This accurately matches the implementation which checks `usedColors` (currently active sessions), not `_everUsedColors`. No work needed.

# session-manager: getAvailableColors JSDoc stale

## Objective

Update `getAvailableColors` JSDoc in `src/session-manager.ts` to match current
implementation.

## Context

PR #126 Copilot comment:
- [r3049754352](https://github.com/electricessence/Telegram-Bridge-MCP/pull/126#discussion_r3049754352)

JSDoc says "hint is promoted only if it has never been assigned" but the
implementation promotes any hint that is "not currently in use" (no longer
consults `_everUsedColors`). Update the comment to match.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JSDoc on `getAvailableColors` accurately describes "not currently in use" behavior
- [ ] Build passes
