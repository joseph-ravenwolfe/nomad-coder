# 10 — Service Message Content Spec

## Summary

Write a spec defining the content, structure, and compression level for
every TMCP service message. This spec governs what each message says and
why. Implementation follows after spec approval.

## Context

Operator reviewed all service messages in PR #141 (constants refactor)
and provided detailed feedback. Key principles:

1. **Ultra compressed** — orders, not textbooks. Apply compression
   principles inline in TypeScript.
2. **Every message ends with help() breadcrumb** — "help('topic') for
   more" on all hints and nudges.
3. **Bundle event type + text** — single frozen object per message,
   not separate maps. Use `Object.freeze` + `as const`.
4. **Audit for "pin" references** — remove all user-facing mentions.
   The pin concept is internal implementation detail.

## Operator Feedback Per Message

### onboarding_token_save

- Current: verbose explanation of token formula
- Target: "Save your token to your session memory file."
- No formula, no sid/pin explanation

### onboarding_protocol (reactions/responsiveness)

- Needs full redesign as a reaction-focused message
- Voice messages arrive pre-saluted (auto 🫡 on dequeue)
- Salute = strongest acknowledgment — explain this
- Agent can weaken by replacing with different reaction
- Processing preset = ideal for audio messages
- Priority levels: temporary vs permanent, timeouts
- Ends with help('reactions') pointer
- Must be ultra compressed

### onboarding_role (governor)

- Add forwarding protocol: governor reads ambiguous messages,
  forwards to correct session via DM with message ID
- Target session uses message/get to read the forwarded message
- Governor routes, doesn't relay content

### onboarding_buttons

- Hybrid message mention should be optional, not default
- Buttons are the focus — hybrid is a "you can also" footnote

### behavior_nudge_* (all nudges)

- Every nudge hint must end with help() pointer
- Keep extremely short — one sentence + help pointer
- Ultra compressed

### Governor change messages

- Deduplicate: "no longer governor", "governor changed",
  "governor switched" → consolidate into single clear message
- Show SID + name label in session references

### DM protocol (new message needed)

- DMs are pure data channel
- No reactions, no typing, no animations in response to DMs
- Reply over DM only — nothing goes to main chat
- Should be part of the multi-session onboarding

### Single emoji warning (new or part of reactions message)

- Single emoji in a text message renders as Telegram sticker
- Warn agents to use multi-character content for status messages

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Spec written with exact target text for each message (Curator)
- [x] All messages ultra compressed
- [x] All messages end with help() breadcrumb where appropriate
- [x] Bundled event type + text structure specified (Object.freeze in service-messages.ts)
- [x] Pin audit: user-facing pin formula removed from onboarding_token_save
- [x] Governor change messages consolidated into single GOVERNOR_CHANGED shape
- [ ] DM protocol message — not in current spec; flagged for follow-up
- [ ] Single emoji sticker warning — covered in help('reactions') docs

## Completion

**Completed:** 2026-04-17
**Branch:** `10-588-service-message-content` (based on `10-service-message-constants-refactor`, Telegram MCP)
**Commit:** `042744d`

**Changes:**
- `src/service-messages.ts` — all message text rewritten per spec; governor variants consolidated to GOVERNOR_CHANGED; nudges get help() breadcrumbs; pin formula removed
- `src/tools/help.ts` — `reactions` added to RICH_TOPICS; DESCRIPTION updated
- `docs/help/reactions.md` — new reactions help topic
- Call sites updated: `built-in-commands.ts`, `health-check.ts`, `session-teardown.ts`, `behavior-tracker.ts`, `tools/session_start.ts`

**Note:** Branch is based on `10-service-message-constants-refactor` (not yet merged to dev). Curator to merge sequence: constants-refactor → content-spec → dev.

## Dependencies

- PR #141 (constants refactor) should merge first for structure
- This spec governs content rewrites as a follow-up PR

## Ownership

Curator writes the spec. Workers implement after approval.
