## Re-queued (2026-04-08)

Task was in `3-in-progress/` but stalled. Worktree `.worktrees/10-336` exists and is clean (no uncommitted changes). Branch `10-336` has 3 commits including a dev merge (`0f58421`). Ready for Worker pickup — resume from existing worktree.

### Previous Status: Blocked → Unblocked

Overseer forward-merged `dev` into `10-336` (commit `0f58421`). All tests now pass.

> **⚠️ RE-QUEUED (2026-04-07):** This task was previously marked complete but
> the branch was never merged to main. An existing worktree with uncommitted
> work may exist. The Worker must:
> 1. Check for an existing worktree branch matching this task ID
> 2. If found, review the existing work before starting fresh
> 3. Merge or rebase as appropriate — do not duplicate effort
> 4. Ensure all files are committed before marking complete

# MCP Port Conflict Detection on Startup

## Problem

The Telegram MCP server does not detect existing instances when starting up. On Windows, Node.js HTTP servers default to `SO_REUSEADDR`, which allows multiple processes to bind the same port without error. This means:

1. A second `pnpm start` succeeds silently — prints "listening on 3099" even though another instance already has the port
2. Both instances receive connections unpredictably
3. Agents connect to whichever instance the kernel routes to
4. No error, no warning, no indication anything is wrong

Discovered during cold start testing: an external terminal launch appeared to fail (probe got 400 Bad Request due to wrong format), so a second instance was launched. Both ran simultaneously, causing session confusion.

## Root Cause

- `app.listen(mcpPort, "127.0.0.1", callback)` in `src/index.ts` (~line 194) has no error handler
- Windows `SO_REUSEADDR` means `EADDRINUSE` never fires — both processes successfully bind
- No pre-flight port check before calling `.listen()`

## Required Fix

### 1. Pre-flight port probe (before `.listen()`)

Before starting the HTTP server, attempt a TCP connection to `127.0.0.1:${port}`. If something is already listening:

- Log `[fatal] Port ${port} is already in use — another MCP instance may be running`
- Exit with non-zero code

Implementation: use `net.createConnection()` with a short timeout. If `connect` event fires, the port is occupied. If `error` event fires with `ECONNREFUSED`, the port is free.

### 2. Set `exclusiveAddress` on the server

Node.js `server.listen()` accepts `{ exclusive: true }` which sets `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` on Windows, preventing port sharing. This is the primary defense.

```typescript
const server = app.listen({
  port: mcpPort,
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  exclusive: true
}, () => { ... });

server.on('error', (err) => {
  if (err.code === 'EADDRINUSE') {
    process.stderr.write(`[fatal] Port ${mcpPort} already in use\n`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  throw err;
});
```

### 3. Fix probe script format

`tools/ensure-telegram-mcp.ps1` sends a JSON-RPC `ping` request, but the Streamable HTTP transport returns 400 for bare JSON-RPC without proper MCP framing. The probe needs to match the actual transport protocol, or use a simpler health endpoint.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Second `pnpm start` on same port fails immediately with clear error message
- [ ] `ensure-telegram-mcp.ps1` probe correctly detects a running MCP instance
- [ ] Works on both Windows and Linux

## Files to Modify

- `src/index.ts` — add exclusive listen + error handler
- `tools/ensure-telegram-mcp.ps1` — fix probe request format (bridge repo)

## Scope

Small — under 20 lines of server code changes. Probe fix is a few lines of PowerShell.

## Completion

**What changed:**

- `src/index.ts` (Telegram MCP repo, branch `10-336`, commit `5363675`): Replaced `app.listen(port, host, cb)` with options-object form using `exclusive: true` (sets `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` on Windows). Added `server.on('error')` handler — logs `[fatal] Port already in use` and exits with code 1 on `EADDRINUSE`. Previously, a second instance would bind silently without error.

- `tools/ensure-telegram-mcp.ps1` (bridge repo, branch `10-336`, commit `e711ad1`): Replaced `Get-NetTCPConnection` port probe with a `TcpClient` connect attempt. `Get-NetTCPConnection` requires elevation on some systems and can return stale state; `TcpClient` is reliable and unprivileged.

**Findings:** No code review findings. Pre-existing test failures (8) confirmed on dev branch before any changes — not regressions.

**Curator verification:** Confirmed genuine new work (not duplicate of commit `6ffbb90`, which is about Telegram update_id gap detection, not port binding).

## Completion — Worker 2 Re-Verification (2026-04-08)

Re-verified by Worker 2 after re-queue. Branch was behind `dev` — Overseer forward-merged `dev` into `10-336` (commit `0f58421`).

**Build Verifier (post-merge):** `pnpm build` PASS · `pnpm lint` PASS · `pnpm test` 2068/2068 PASS

**Code Review:** `minor_only`
- [MINOR] `src/index.ts:210-216` — `process.exit(1)` bypasses graceful shutdown handlers; acceptable since no sessions exist at EADDRINUSE time (server never started)
- [INFO] `exclusive: true` is only load-bearing on Windows; Linux prevents duplicate binds via normal OS semantics — acceptance criteria still met on both platforms

**Doc Audit:** Missing changelog entry found. Task Runner added entry to `changelog/unreleased.md` (commit `411b58b`).

**Second Code Review:** `clean` — changelog entry factually accurate and correctly placed.

**Status:** Ready for Overseer merge to dev. No blocking findings.
