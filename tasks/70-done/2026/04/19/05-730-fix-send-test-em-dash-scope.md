# 05-730 - Fix send.test.ts: invert em-dash warning expectations to match 20-716

## Context

Pre-merge pnpm gate on dev (commit 912730a, 2026-04-19) found 14 test failures in `src/tools/send.test.ts`. All in the "unrenderable char warning" paths.

20-716 (commit 13f9d9c) removed `0x2014` (em-dash) and `0x2013` (en-dash) from `UNRENDERABLE_CHARS` and updated `src/unrenderable-chars.test.ts` to match. But it missed the integration tests in `src/tools/send.test.ts`, which still assert that em-dash in a message body triggers `deliverServiceMessage` with a U+2014 warning. CI on PR #136 is blocked on these 14 failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Open `src/tools/send.test.ts`.
2. For each test in the "unrenderable char warning" / "em dash" / "em-dash" / "U+2014" groups: invert the expectation so em-dash content does NOT fire `deliverServiceMessage` and no U+2014 warning string is present. Same for any en-dash test.
3. Keep any arrow-char (U+2192, etc.) tests intact - arrows are still flagged.
4. Optionally: add one regression test that em-dash-only content emits zero warnings, to lock the new behavior.
5. Run `pnpm lint`: clean.
6. Run `pnpm test`: all 2441 green (or +N if you added tests).
7. Commit inside your worktree on branch `05-730`.

## Constraints

- Do not re-introduce em/en dash blocking anywhere; 20-716's decision stands.
- Do not touch the arrow-char tests or the core `UNRENDERABLE_CHARS` table.
- Do not broaden scope to a test-suite cleanup; just invert the em/en dash assertions.

## Priority

05 - blocker. Direct gate to v7 master merge.

## Delegation

Worker (TMCP). Curator stages, Overseer reviews, operator merges.
