# 05 — 591 — Base Reaction Overwrites Temporary Reactions

## Priority: P0 — visible UX bug, reactions disappear

## Summary

The implicit base reaction (👌 at -100) overwrites active temporary
reactions because Telegram's `setMessageReaction` is a REPLACE operation,
not additive. Temporary reactions disappear immediately after being set.

## Root Cause

In `src/tools/set_reaction.ts`, `_insertBaseReaction()` fires
asynchronously after a temporary reaction is set. The sequence:

1. Temp reaction set: `setMessageReaction([🤔])` — shows 🤔
2. Base fires async: `setMessageReaction([👌])` — REPLACES 🤔 with 👌
3. Temp timeout fires: removes 🤔 → sets `[]` — message goes bare

Every `setMessageReaction` call sends the FULL reaction list, not a
diff. The base call doesn't know about the active temporary.

## Fix

The base insertion must be coordination-aware. Options:

**Option A (recommended):** Defer base insertion. Don't fire the base
API call immediately — only insert it when the last temporary reaction
expires. The temp-reaction cleanup code should set `[👌]` instead of
`[]` when clearing the last temporary.

**Option B:** Combine reactions in API calls. When setting any reaction,
always include the base in the array: `setMessageReaction([🤔, 👌])`.
But Telegram only supports ONE reaction per bot — so this won't work.

**Option C:** Track base state locally only. Don't make an API call for
the base. Instead, when the temp-reaction cleanup fires and needs to
restore, it checks the local base state and sets `[👌]` if a base was
registered. The base never hits the API on its own.

Option C is cleanest — no race condition, no extra API calls, base is
just a local state flag that the cleanup code uses as the restore target.

## Mental Model

There is ONE active in-flight reaction at the Telegram API level at any
time. Below it is a LOCAL priority queue of virtual reactions. Only the
top one is real (sent to API). Everything below is virtual until it
surfaces.

When the top reaction expires or is removed:
1. Check the priority queue for the next item
2. If found → send it to API (it becomes the new active in-flight)
3. If queue empty → clear the reaction via API

The base at -100 is always the bottom of the queue. It never fires its
own API call — it only becomes real when everything above it clears.

This must work for ALL permutations:
- Single temporary → expires → base surfaces
- Multiple temporaries in sequence → each visible for its duration → base surfaces last
- Permanent reaction set → replaces everything (base still queued below)
- Processing preset (👀 5s → 🤔 temp) → 👀 visible → 🤔 visible → base surfaces

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Temporary reaction stays visible for its full timeout duration
- [ ] After temporary expires, base reaction (👌) appears
- [ ] No intermediate flash of 👌 during temporary period
- [ ] Multiple temporary reactions in sequence work correctly
- [ ] Processing preset (👀→🤔) works without base interference
- [ ] All existing reaction tests pass + new test for this scenario

## Files to Change

- `src/tools/set_reaction.ts` — `_insertBaseReaction()` logic
- `src/temp-reaction.ts` — cleanup/restore logic
- `src/tools/set_reaction.test.ts` — new test case

## Delegation

Worker task. P0 priority — file immediately.

## Completion

Implemented Option C. Branch: `05-591-base-reaction-overwrite-bug`. Commit: `c70c9f0`.

- `_insertBaseReaction` now calls only `markBaseReaction` — no API call.
- `temp-reaction.ts` restore paths (`_fireRestoreForSlot`, `clearAllTempReactions`) check `hasBaseReaction(chatId, messageId)` when `restoreEmoji` is null; surface 👌 instead of clearing to `[]`.
- Import of `hasBaseReaction` added to `temp-reaction.ts`.
- New tests in `temp-reaction.test.ts`: base surfaces on timeout, base surfaces on outbound restore.
- New test in `set_reaction.test.ts`: no API call for 👌 during temp period.
- TypeScript build: PASS. Tests blocked by missing `node_modules` in worktree (pnpm install not permitted by hook — needs Overseer to run tests).
