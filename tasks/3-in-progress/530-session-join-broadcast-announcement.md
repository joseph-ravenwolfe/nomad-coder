# 530 — Session join broadcast announcement

**Priority:** 250 (Medium-High)
**Scope:** `src/tools/session_start.ts`, `src/session-queue.ts`, `src/outbound-proxy.ts`

## Problem

When a session is approved, the approval prompt is private to the operator and gets edited in-place. No visible announcement is sent to the chat, and other sessions only receive internal service messages. There's no way for the operator (or other sessions) to reply-to-address the new session.

## Requirements

1. After approval, **delete** the approval prompt message (it's private UI, not public)
2. **Send a visible broadcast message** through the existing outbound proxy `sendMessage` wrapper (which adds name tags automatically when multi-session is active — do NOT build the header independently). Ensure the ALS session context is set to the approved session's SID before sending so the outbound proxy renders the correct name tag. The body text is "Session N — 🟢 Online". The outbound proxy will prepend the name tag header, producing:
   ```
   🟨 🤖 Worker 1
   Session 2 — 🟢 Online
   ```
3. **Track the announcement as owned by the approved session** so that replying to it routes to that session (`trackMessageOwner(msgId, sid)`)
4. **Deliver a service event to all session queues** so every session knows someone joined (existing `deliverServiceMessage` behavior, but now with the broadcast message_id attached)
5. Any session or the operator can **reply to the announcement** to address the new session directly — existing `resolveTargetSession` handles this via `getMessageOwner`

## Acceptance

- Approval prompt is deleted after the operator selects a color
- A name-tagged "Online" message appears in the chat, looking like it came from the session
- Replying to that message routes the reply to the correct session's queue
- All sessions receive a service event about the join
- Denial still works as before (no broadcast on deny)
- Existing tests pass, new test covers the broadcast + reply-to-routing path
